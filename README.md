# xmas-data-bridge
Frontend for my [Interactive xmas tree](https://github.com/fancyn3rd?tab=projects#interactive-xmas-tree) project.

Its a webapp that uses [pixi.js](https://www.pixijs.com/) to render an xmas tree and xmas tree balls. It listens to topics of a local mqtt broker to update the number of xmas tree balls.

**Install**

    npm install


**Usage**

    npm run start
